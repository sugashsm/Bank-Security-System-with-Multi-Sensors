# Bank-Security-System-with-Multi-Sensors
The Automatic Bank Alarm System with Sensor Integration and Wireless Communication aims to enhance security measures in banking environments by incorporating sensors and wireless modules. This project utilizes Light Dependent Resistors (LDR) to detect environmental brightness and  Passive Infrared (PIR) sensors to detect motion within the bank premises and door contacts to monitor entry and exit points. The system adjusts alarm sensitivity based on the presence of motion and unauthorized access, effectively deterring potential intruders and enhancing overall security. Additionally, it employs an ESP8266 Wi-Fi module for wireless communication, enabling real-time alerts and remote monitoring of alarm events. The project showcases the feasibility and benefits of integrating smart security systems in banking facilities, ensuring the safety of customers and assets.
